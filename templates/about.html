            <h3>Sport and Physical Activity Arising from Covid-19</h3>
            <p>As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic countries worldwide have introduced social distancing,
                    quarantine, and lockdown policies with the aims of reducing the spread of infection. These policies
                    have fostered an environment that leads to a reduction in physical activity and sports participation
                    due to fewer opportunities to remain active and a fear of infection (Pinto, Dunstan, Owen, Bonfa &
                    Gualano, 2020). The lasting effects of this change on our physical activity and sporting behaviours
                    post-pandemic remain unclear (Hall, Laddu, Phillips, Lavie & Arena, 2020), however research exploring
                    physical activity levels after natural disaster indicates a long-term reduction in activity levels (Okazaki,
                    Suzuki, Sakamoto & Sasaki, 2015).
            </p>
            <p>A recent systematic review, exploring physical activity and sedentary behaviour in Covid-19 related
                      lockdown, indicates an overall decrease in physical activity among healthy adults, healthy children and
                      adolescents, and those with medical conditions (Stockwell et al, 2021). A number of studies found that
                      those with higher levels of physical activity pre-lockdown were more likely to have larger decreases in
                      physical activity during Covid-19 restrictions (Stockwell et al, 2021). These findings should be viewed
                      with caution, however, due to the subjective design of the majority of included studies and the
                      inclusion of measures and tools which lack prior validation (Stockwell et al, 2021). With this in mind,
                      it is clear from the literature that Covid-19 has had a negative impact on physical activity and sports
                      globally, with deleterious outcomes associated with this reduction including wellbeing, mental health,
                      and Covid-19 recovery (REF e.g., Puccinelli et al, 2021;). 
            </p>
            <h3>Policy and Campaigns</h3>
            <p>In 2021 UNESCO published a policy brief presenting the importance of investing in inclusive, quality,
              physical education policy development which incorporates inter-sectoral partnerships, low-cost
              programming to accelerate post Covid-19 recovery (UNESCO, 2021). Policy development should
              contain these key components: local ownership, participation, inclusiveness, gender sensitivity, and
              empowerment (UNESCO, 2021), and should aim to advance international physical activity and sport
              development agendas e.g., UN Sustainable Development Goals, WHO’s Global Action Plan on Physical
              Activity, UNESCO’s Kazan Action Plan, and Beijing Platform for Action (UNESCO, 2021). This policy brief
              also emphasises the importance of digitization but highlights the intersectional nature of the digital
              divide and the necessity of providing low-tech alternatives (UNESCO, 2021).
